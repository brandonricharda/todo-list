This is my solution to The Odin Project's Todo List assignment, which you can learn more about here:

## Application Walkthrough

### Default Page

When you open the app for the first time, it will look blank like this:

### Adding a Project

Too add your first Project, click the circular "+" button beside "Projects" at the top left:

Give the project a name, then hit "Create." If you would like to cancel creating a project, you can click "Cancel" and the form will go away.

### Adding a Task to a Project

To add a Task, click the circular "+" button beside "Tasks."

Note: If you just created a project, the task you create will be assigned to that project by default. You can change this, however, by clicking on a project in the left hand sidebar (it will highlight on hover).

### Changing the Project View

At any time, you can choose a project from the left hand sidebar to display its tasks (and add any new tasks you create to it).

### Interacting with Tasks

Each Task item comes with three buttons: Complete, Info, and Delete.

Complete changes the Task's status to "Complete." If you click "Complete" on a Task that was already completed, you'll receive an alert.

Clicking Info prompts an alert that contains the Task's description.

Clicking Delete will remove the Task completely from storage and the view.
